<h3>Description:</h3>

<i>Hot Potato</i> is a children's game in which a "potato"
is rapidly tossed around until, at some arbitrary point, the game ends.
The child holding the potato is "it."
(One does not want to be it.)
In this assignment you will create a ring of "player"
processes that will pass the potato around; therefore,
each player will have a left and a right neighbor.
Furthermore, you will create a "ringmaster" process that
will start each game, report the results, and shut down the network.
<p>
To begin, the ringmaster creates a potato with some number of hops and
sends it to a randomly selected player.
Each time a player receives the potato, it will decrement the number
of hops and append its identity on the potato.
If the remaining number of hops is greater than zero, it will randomly
select a neighbor and send the potato to that neighbor.
The game ends when the hops counter reaches zero.
The player holding the potato sends it to the ringmaster indicating
the end of this game.
The ringmaster prints a trace of the game (from the identities that
are appended to the potato) to the screen, and shuts down the network.
The trace consists of the path the potato took
(that is, the players in the order they held the potato).
</p><p>
Each player process will create three connections: left, right, and
ringmaster.
The potato can arrive on any of the three connections.
Commands and important information may also be received from the
ringmaster. 
The ringmaster will create <i>n</i> connections, one for each player.
At the end of a game the ringmaster will receive the potato from the
player who is "it."
</p><p>
The assignment is to create one ringmaster and some number of
player processes, then play a game and terminate all processes
gracefully.
You may explicitly create each process from an interactive shell;
however, the player processes must exit themselves in response to commands
from the ringmaster.
</p><p>
<strong>The programs will use Unix sockets for communication.</strong>
</p><p>
Establishing communication between all processes will be the
most difficult part of the assignment.  
Therefore, you should start small and work up to the full ring
topology.
</p><p>
Your programs must use exactly the format described here.
The ringmaster program is invoked as shown below (the words and the angled
brackets are figurative, and should be replaced with an appropriate
value):
</p><pre>    master &lt;port-number&gt; &lt;number-of-players&gt; &lt;hops&gt;</pre>
where <tt>number-of-players</tt> is greater than one and <tt>hops</tt>
is non-negative.
<p>
The player programs are invoked thusly:
</p><pre>    player &lt;master-machine-name&gt; &lt;port-number&gt;</pre>
where <tt>master-machine-name</tt> is the name of the machine on which
<tt>master</tt> was invoked and <tt>port-number</tt> is the same as
was passed to <tt>master</tt>.
Players are numbered beginning with 0.
The players are connected in the ring such that the left neighbor of
player <i>n</i> is player <i>n</i>-1 and the right neighbor is player <i>n</i>+1.
(Player 0 is the right neighbor of last player (<tt>number_of_players</tt>-1).
<p>
Zero (0) is a valid number of hops.
In this case, your program must create the ring of processes.
<strong>After</strong> the ring is created, the ringmaster shuts down the
game.

</p><hr>
<h3>Turn In:</h3>
Be sure to turnin <b>all</b> the files needed.
Include a <tt>Makefile</tt> that creates two executable files
called <tt>master</tt> and <tt>player</tt>.
An appropriate penalty will be assessed if this is not so.
<p>
Also, denote any resources used--including other students--in a file
named <b>REFERENCES</b>.

</p><hr>

<h3>Resources:</h3>
Two programs have been provided to get you started with sockets.
The <tt>listen</tt> program creates a socket and accepts
connections with other processes.
The <tt>speak</tt> program establishes a connection with <tt>listen</tt>.
Then it sends the characters typed to its terminal to the
<tt>listen</tt> process, which prints them on its terminal.
At EOF (<code>^D</code>) <tt>speak</tt> closes the connection and
terminates.
<tt>listen</tt> continues to accept connections from other
processes.
(To terminate <tt>listen</tt> use <code>^C</code>.
Note: the port is not completely shutdown.)
<p>
Download the tar file
</p><blockquote>
<a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/socket.tar.gz">socket.tar.gz</a>
</blockquote>
into your working directory.  Unpack the archive using the following command
<blockquote>
<pre>gunzip -c potato.tar.gz | tar xf -</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
In separate windows (but on one machine) execute the two
programs.
Then try using the programs on different machines.
You must pick an unused port number and give it to both programs.
</p><p>
RTFM--Read the fine manual.

<h3>Output:</h3>

The programs you create must follow the description below
precisely.
If you deviate from what is expected, your grade will suffer because:
<ul>
  <li> The instructor may not be able to figure out how to invoke the program,
  </li><li> The instructor may not see what he is looking for, or
  </li><li> The instructor may be annoyed.
</li></ul>

<h3>Testing:</h3>
This assignment will be compiled and tested on one or more
of the VCL machines.
Several configurations will be tested.
The code will be tested on the VCL image named
<a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/submit.html">here.</a>

<hr>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Port numbers less than 1024 are reserved.
Therefore, you must select larger port numbers and this port number
must not have been assigned yet.
A port number can be anywhere from 0 to 2^16-1, so it should be very
easy to select unused ports.
However, if your programs select a used port number, socket
initialization will fail.
Your program must handle this situation and terminate gracefully.

</li>
  <li>Seed the random number generator so that your results are
  repeatable.</li>
